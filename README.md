# Welcome to My Printf
***

## Task

The task is to rebuild the ubiquitous built in function, printf.

## Description

To solve the problem, I defined all the format specifiers I will create functionality for, douxscp, and then wrote specific logic to handle each case.

## Installation

To use the project, clone the repo, enter into int main() the my_printf examples you would like to run, then in your cli navigate to the directory where the file is, enter 'make my_printf', then run the executable file './my_printf', and it will be displayed in your cli.

## Usage

It works by taking in the function's input, and if there is a % sign denoting a format specifier, it will then run the corresponding logic associated with the format specifier. The function will print the input, and return the length of the string.
